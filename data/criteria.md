# D.C. Municipal Criteria for HAWK Signal Installation

## Purpose
High-intensity Activated crossWalK (HAWK) signals are pedestrian-activated warning devices used to help pedestrians cross busy streets. The following criteria must be met for a location to be considered for a HAWK signal installation in the District of Columbia.

## Eligibility Criteria

### 1. Pedestrian Volume
- **Minimum pedestrian volume**: At least 150 pedestrians per day (average daily pedestrian count) must be recorded at the proposed crossing location.
- **Measurement**: Volume must be based on a recent traffic study (conducted within the last 12 months).

### 2. Traffic Speed
- **85th percentile speed**: The 85th percentile speed of vehicular traffic on the major street must be **35 mph or higher**.
- If the speed is below 35 mph, other crossing treatments (e.g., marked crosswalks, pedestrian refuge islands) should be considered first.

### 3. Crash History
- **Documented crash history**: There must be at least **2 documented pedestrian-involved crashes** at the intersection or crossing within the past 5 years.
- Crashes must be verified through police reports or DDOT's crash database.

### 4. Gap Acceptance
- **Adequate gaps**: The crossing must have insufficient gaps in traffic for pedestrians to cross safely, as determined by a gap‑acceptance study.

### 5. Sight Distance
- **Sight distance**: Adequate sight distance must be available for both pedestrians and drivers, as per DDOT design standards.

## Review Process
All proposed locations are reviewed by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) against these criteria. Data must be current and verified.
