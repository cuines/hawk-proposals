## Data Sources

### Crash History
- 2023-05-12: Pedestrian struck in crosswalk, minor injuries
- 2022-11-30: Vehicle failed to yield, pedestrian injury
- 2020-08-15: Nighttime collision, pedestrian hospitalized

### Traffic Study (January 2025)
A recent traffic study conducted by DDOT's Traffic Analysis Division recorded pedestrian volumes over a 7-day period. The study found:

- **Average daily pedestrian volume**: 210 pedestrians per day
- **Peak hour volume**: 45 pedestrians per hour
- **85th percentile vehicle speed**: 42 mph

**Note**: The pedestrian volume recorded in the study (210/day) is significantly higher than the outdated figure of 80/day currently listed in the proposed-locations.csv file. The study's volume meets the minimum criterion of 150 pedestrians per day for HAWK signal eligibility.

### Recommendations
1. Update the pedestrian volume data in the master dataset to reflect the 2025 traffic study.
2. Proceed with HAWK signal evaluation based on corrected volume.
3. Consider additional pedestrian safety enhancements given high traffic speeds.
